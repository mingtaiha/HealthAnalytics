This folder contains various useful summaries that characterizes our data and
models, and  compares the accuracy of our simulated data to national and
state level statistics and also compare the performance between the state
and national level models. Note that while the model used to generate the
state and national level data is the same, the prediciton range of the national
level model is [Min, Max], whereas the state level models is [Mean - StD,
Mean + StD]

Model_CorrGen4_Accuracy.csv is a file that contains the accuracy of each state
level model generated from the sample CorrGen4 (1% population).

State_Health_Summary_C4100.csv is a file which contains the summary of simulated
sample using the 4th iteration of Correlated Sampling that is 1% of the population
of each state.

 State_Health_Summary_R100.csv is a file which contains the summary of simulated
sample using the Randomly Sampled that is 1% of the population of each state.

The State_Summary_Comparison.csv is the file used to compare the health statistics
of our simulated populations against state and national level statistics.
