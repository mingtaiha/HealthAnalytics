We used CDC data for our project, files are too many to upload here, but a link to the CDC site and the SAS data files can be seen here. http://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/nhanes_continuous.aspx

We manually downloaded these files and did some manual cleanup. Systematic ingestion and final filtering is done by the health model system seen in the code section.
