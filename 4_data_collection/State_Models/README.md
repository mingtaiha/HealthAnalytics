This folder contains the State Level Models for each attribute. The models
are derived from the State Level Data and are in the form of a JSON tree.
Each node has the attributes: key, value, children. All nodes except the root
node contain the attributes: Min, Max (for the prediction ranges).

The models are grouped together into folders by their health statistics.
