The folder Aggregated_State_Tables contain the data used by the application to display
state level statistics in forms of pie charts and histograms

Aside from Gender and Ethnicity, where the categories are represented in pie charts
given the discrete categorization, the other attributes represented using histograms
since each of remaining attributes can take values over continuous ranges. Each of
the remaining tables contain the Average, Mean, Min, and Max, as well as 20 bins.
Each bin has the width (Max - Min) / 20, span from Min to Max, and contains the
percentage of the state sample that falls into the individual bins.
