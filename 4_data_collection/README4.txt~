We used CDC and Census data in our project to generate our health model. Which means many of our scripts are just either exporting data from a file or pulling data from a site. 

CDC:
We used CDC data for our project, there are plenty of files available and we only chose those that we though were necessary for our project, a link to the CDC site and the SAS data files can be seen here. http://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/nhanes_continuous.aspx

Census 2010:
We used Census-2010 data to estimate state-level population. We already exported what we needed and added the json data files here, but we included a document explaining our process. The link used to browse the Census data was: http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census-data.html


Note:
We manually downloaded these files and (in some cases) did some manual cleanup. Systematic ingestion and final filtering is done by the health model system seen in the code section.
