Hello! This is the the README for running the Model component
of the program!

This program assumes that you have Python and PIP installed
on your computer. If you have those Python 2.7.10 installed
and PIP installed, then you can go straight to Step 1. If not,
then continue to Step 0. 

Step 0) If you do not have Python or PIP installed, you can 
find documentation to install the two below:

For Python, Version 2.7.10:

https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download

For PIP:

http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/


Step 1) Once you have Python 2.7.10 and PIP installed, you 
need to run the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs the required packages needed to run the code,
as well as the version of each package.


Step 2) Now that you have installed all the requirements,
you are ready to run the code. You can input the following
line if you are using Linux and are running from the command
line:

```
python Decision_Tree.py
```

Otherwise, you will have to run from your Python IDE of choice

**Note: The data file used for this script must be in the same
folder as the python script. The name of the data file used is
called:

HealthData_10_16_2015.csv


Step 3) That's it! Your code will run, generating the models and
making a prediction based on the characteristics of an individual
hard-coded into the script.
