# Testing the Mobile Application Card.io

For testing please refer to the code section as all unit test cases were done in the code.


The test cases defined for all controllers and services (AngularJS) can be seen under:
`1_code/card.io/tests/` in here you'll find a `Controllers` and `Services` folder with tests
that cover both.  

See the README file in `1_code/card.io` for details on how to run the test cases.
