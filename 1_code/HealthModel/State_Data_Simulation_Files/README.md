This folder contains the script and necessary files to generate state level samples.
To change the percentage of your population, open Data_Simulation.py and change the
value of the variable FRACTION_POPULATION. Note that this number represents denominator
of the fraction of the population which you wish to generate. For example, a value
of 100 implies that you want to generate a sample that is 1/100 of the population
of the US. A value of 10000 implies that your sample is 1/10000 of the population
of the US.
